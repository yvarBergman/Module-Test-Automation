# Module Test Automation
This repository is meant for trainees of Calco to help them learn about automatic tests.

# Setup your local environment
To get started a few things are required:
   - Nodejs (Which you can get from https://nodejs.org/en/)
   - An IDE or texteditor in which you can edit Javascript (Atom (https://atom.io) is a good choice for this)
   - Git (https://git-scm.com)
   - Clone the repository to your local environment
   - Install the project dependencies by running the command: 'npm install'
   - Install nightwatch (http://nightwatchjs.org) globally by running the command: 'npm install -g nightwatch'
   - Download selenium-standalone globally by running the command: 'npm install -g selenium-standalone', then install the drivers themselves by running the command 'selenium-standalone install'
   
Optional:
   - It is advised to use a Git Client (like Github Desktop, GitKraken, Sourcetree etc.) to have a clearer understanding of your branches
